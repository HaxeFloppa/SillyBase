# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will be making sure every version will have supported security updates, well, like I'll even release another version considering that this project is for fun to
play around with the concept of NoSQL databases (e.g. mongodb, that uses JSON documents to hold information instead of tables written in SQL)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, simillar to that of said in the code of conduct file: you can just contact my email <b>rafaelandyhailu@gmail.com</b>
