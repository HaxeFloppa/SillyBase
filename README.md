<h2 align="center">Make a new table and manage it</h2>
<p align="center">To create and alter the data of a new table, you'll need to define the table by writing:  </p>
    NEW TABLE (make a preferred name for your table)
<p align="center">To alter the data and see the data of a table, you'll need to call it by the address:</p>
    NEW TABLE Pennywise
    INSERT AT 0 Nickelsmart
    LOGS 0
<p align="center">It's a very tedious process, but you can just spam the "INSERT AT" and "LOGS" command to print more than 1 line as shown:</p>
    NEW TABLE Pennywise
    INSERT AT 0 Nickelsmart
    LOGS 0
    INSERT AT 0 Quarterintelligent
    LOGS 0
    INSERT AT 0 Coin-knowledge
    LOGS 0
